# PokÃ©mon Data Upgrade Guide - Gen 1 + Gen 2

This guide explains how to fetch and seed PokÃ©mon data for Generations 1 and 2 (PokÃ©mon #1-251).

## Overview

Your seed file was previously 1320 lines and 96KB. The new approach:
- âœ… **Automated** - Fetches data from PokeAPI
- âœ… **Clean** - Seed logic is separate from data
- âœ… **Maintainable** - Easy to add more generations
- âœ… **Complete** - Includes all stats, abilities, sprites, lore

## New Structure

```
prisma/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/                          # JSON data files (auto-generated)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pokemon.json              # Basic info (id, name, types)
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ stats.json                # Base stats
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ species.json              # Height, weight, species
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ evYields.json             # EV training yields
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ pokemonAbilities.json     # PokÃ©mon â†’ Abilities mapping
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ abilities.json            # Ability descriptions
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ evolutionChains.json      # Evolution data
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lore.json                 # Descriptions
â”œâ”€â”€ seed-new.ts                    # New optimized seeder (reads JSON)
â””â”€â”€ seed.ts                        # Old seeder (backup)

scripts/
â””â”€â”€ fetch-pokemon-data.ts          # Fetches data from PokeAPI
```

## Step-by-Step Instructions

### Step 1: Fetch Data from PokeAPI

This will take ~30-40 minutes (rate-limited to be nice to PokeAPI).

```bash
npm run fetch-data
```

**What it does:**
- Fetches PokÃ©mon #1-251 from PokeAPI
- Includes: stats, abilities, sprites, descriptions, evolutions
- Generates JSON files in `prisma/data/`
- Shows progress for each PokÃ©mon

**Output:**
```
ðŸš€ Fetching data for PokÃ©mon 1-251 from PokeAPI...
âœ… Fetched Bulbasaur (#1)
âœ… Fetched Ivysaur (#2)
...
âœ… Fetched Celebi (#251)
ðŸ’¾ Saving data to JSON files...
ðŸŽ‰ Data fetch complete!
```

### Step 2: Seed the Database

Once the JSON files are generated:

```bash
npm run db:seed
```

**What it does:**
- Reads JSON files from `prisma/data/`
- Upserts PokÃ©mon (updates existing, creates new)
- Seeds abilities
- Links PokÃ©mon to abilities
- Creates evolution chains

**Output:**
```
ðŸŒŸ Starting database seed...
ðŸŽ® Seeding PokÃ©mon...
âœ… Seeded 251 PokÃ©mon
ðŸ”— Seeding evolution chains...
âœ… Seeded evolution chains
ðŸŽ¯ Seeding abilities...
âœ… Seeded abilities
ðŸ”— Linking PokÃ©mon to abilities...
âœ… Linked PokÃ©mon to abilities
âœ¨ Seed completed successfully!
```

## What's Included

### Gen 1 (PokÃ©mon #1-151)
- Kanto region from FireRed/LeafGreen
- All original 151 PokÃ©mon
- Complete stats, abilities, evolutions

### Gen 2 (PokÃ©mon #152-251)
- Johto region from Gold/Silver/Crystal
- Includes: Chikorita, Cyndaquil, Totodile lines
- Dark and Steel types
- New evolutions for Gen 1 PokÃ©mon (Crobat, Steelix, etc.)
- Legendary beasts, Ho-Oh, Lugia, Celebi

## Data Fields

Each PokÃ©mon includes:
- âœ… National Dex number
- âœ… Name and display name
- âœ… Types (primary and secondary)
- âœ… Base stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Sp. Atk, Sp. Def, Speed)
- âœ… Species name (e.g., "Seed PokÃ©mon")
- âœ… Height (meters) and Weight (kg)
- âœ… Catch rate
- âœ… EV yields
- âœ… Abilities (including hidden abilities)
- âœ… Sprite URLs (normal, shiny, animated)
- âœ… Flavor text descriptions
- âœ… Evolution chains

## Troubleshooting

### "Failed to fetch PokÃ©mon #X"
- PokeAPI might be slow or rate-limiting
- The script will continue with other PokÃ©mon
- You can re-run `npm run fetch-data` - it will update all data

### "PokÃ©mon not found for evolution chain"
- Some evolution chains might reference PokÃ©mon outside Gen 1-2
- The script skips these and warns you
- This is normal and expected

### Want to fetch more generations?
Edit `scripts/fetch-pokemon-data.ts` and change:
```typescript
const MAX_POKEMON = 251; // Change to 386 for Gen 3, 493 for Gen 4, etc.
```

## Backup Your Old Seed

Your original seed file is preserved as `prisma/seed.ts`. You can still run it with:
```bash
npm run db:seed-old
```

## Next Steps

After seeding:
1. **Update UI** - Your app will now show Gen 1 + Gen 2 PokÃ©mon
2. **Update copy** - Change "151 PokÃ©mon" to "251 PokÃ©mon" in marketing text
3. **Test** - Browse the PokÃ©dex and check that Gen 2 PokÃ©mon appear
4. **Deploy** - Push changes and redeploy

## Benefits of This Approach

1. **Maintainable**: Seed logic is ~300 lines, data is in JSON
2. **Extensible**: Easy to add Gen 3, 4, 5... just change `MAX_POKEMON`
3. **Accurate**: Data comes directly from PokeAPI (community-maintained)
4. **Fast seeding**: Reading JSON is much faster than embedding 1300+ lines
5. **Version control friendly**: Can `.gitignore` large JSON files if needed
